("-" means "still to do"; "/" means "done"; "x" means "not going to do")

/ test-drive rwlock

/ expectAction() inside action methods

/ put TestThread methods in breadth-first order

/ have TestThread throw IllegalStateException instead  of assertions in a few places

/ review synchronized usage in TestThread

/ making coding style consistent

/ rename *Tests to *Test

/ delete ThreadTests, but move isBlocked somewhere reasonable

/ in ReadWriteLock, decrement correctly when waiting writer is interrupted

/ get rid of now-unused timed-wait stuff in Semaphore

/ get rid of redundent lock object in Semaphore

/ get rid of the try/catch to deal with different ordering in
  SemaphoreTest#testThreeThreadsOneResource, since we're presuming that the
  order is deterministic until we learn otherwise

/ remove unused imports

/ move examples to subpackage

/ come up with a good way to stop TestThread

/ discuss code review techniques: notify, synchronized, etc.

/ copy BoundedBuffer to BrokenBoundedBuffer

x make checkpoint optional (so don't always have to "perform" it)

/ introduce FixedBoundedBuffer

/ eliminate duplication between BrokenBoundedBufferTest and FixedBoundedBufferTest

/ test-drive fixing the notify/notifyAll problems in examples using
  "checkpoint" method
  <http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingChallengeFourteenTheBug>

/ try putting TestThreads in a ThreadGroup so that letRun can let them all run

/ discuss blocking with unrelated threads on [[I object

- review/fix other notify() call in BoundedBuffer

/ fix wait() not in while in Semaphore

/ add jar and javadoc Ant targets

/ include pre-built jar and javadoc in distribution

/ link to javadoc from home page

- if exception is thrown from action, rethrow it from assertComplete
  (instead of calling printStackTrace)

- if InterruptedException is thrown from action, allow that fact to
  be asserted

/ include thread and action name in assertions

- rewrite overview on home page

/ link to dist files from home page

- consider how to test timed-wait stuff in Semaphore

- remove "beta" comment about Java 1.5

- document need to make TestThread subclasses public

- move reflection code out so that any problems get raised in the calling
  thread before sending the action to the TestThread

- if exception thrown from action, throw AssertionFailedError from performAction
  (or assertStillBlocked) with that exception as its cause

- allow assert that an exception *should* be thrown

- don't throw InterruptedException from TestThread.checkpoint(); however, make
  sure kill() still works

- add deadlock detection using findMonitorDeadlockedThreads (Java 5) and/or
  findDeadlockedThreads (Java 6) 

- detect if two locks are ever acquired in opposite order

- allow defining doXYZ methods in test class rather than requiring an inner
  class

/ register jthreadunit.org

/ change package to org.jthreadunit

- change to Maven build

- deploy docs & jar on jthreadunit.org

- deploy jar to Maven central repository

- update SourceForge page to point to jthreadunit.org and GitHub
