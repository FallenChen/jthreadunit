        <h1>JThreadUnit</h1>

        <p>Copyright 2004 by <a href="mailto:jsampson@users.sourceforge.net">Justin Sampson</a></p>

        <p>JThreadUnit supports deterministic unit testing of multithreaded
        Java code. It is a simple add-on to the JUnit unit testing framework. A
        test creates several <tt>TestThread</tt> instances which it can control
        at various granularities, including testing for whether a thread is
        blocked after a controlled sequence of concurrent operations.</p>

        <p>This project already has useful code written for immediate release.
        The project will distribute that code, coordinate enhancements, and
        serve as a focal point for advancing the science and art of
        deterministic unit testing of multithreaded Java code.</p>

        <p>There are a few packages out there for testing multithreaded Java
        code, but all use a nondeterministic load-based approach, executing a
        large number of concurrent operations repeatedly to uncover defects.
        This project will differentiate itself by promoting deterministic unit
        testing techniques.</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>

        <p>A handful of examples are included, which also serve as the tests
        for <tt>TestThread</tt> itself. In fact, initially I started by
        test-driving <tt>Semaphore</tt> and figuring out what I needed.
        <tt>TestThread</tt> emerged from those tests.</p>

        <p>One of the most common errors in multithreaded Java programming is
        using <tt>notify()</tt> where <tt>notifyAll()</tt> is required, and
        this has also been one of the hardest errors to test, until now. Some
        of the examples still use <tt>notify()</tt> incorrectly, and this is
        intentional&mdash;I will leave them that way until I get around to
        writing a test that actually uncovers the bug.</p>

        <p>Try it: Change any <tt>notifyAll()</tt> in the examples to
        <tt>notify()</tt> and a test should fail. If none does, let me know!
        <tt>:)</tt></p>

        <p>And for any remaining usage of <tt>notify()</tt> which you believe
        is incorrect, please submit a test case that proves it.</p>

        <p>Please see <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingChallengeFourteen">ExtremeProgrammingChallengeFourteen</a>
        for inspiration. Its <tt>BoundedBuffer</tt> problem is included in the
        examples, complete with a test for the bug and a fixed version of the
        class.</p>

        <h2>Caveats</h2>

        <p>JThreadUnit requires Java 1.5, which is still in beta. It uses the
        new <tt>java.lang.management</tt> facilities (specifically,
        <tt>ThreadMBean</tt>) to check whether a thread is blocked or running.
        My original approach, prior to Java 1.5, simply did a timed wait for a
        signal from the thread; if the signal fired within the wait time, the
        thread was obviously not blocked, and if the signal did not fire within
        that time, the thread was presumed to be blocked. This was both slow
        and fragile, so I've been waiting and watching for some way to actually
        get under the thread manager's skin and see what's going on. Now we
        have it, and the code is much simpler now, as well as faster and more
        robust.</p>

        <p>There are two remaining imperfections:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>A few of the tests (the trickiest ones) rely on the ordering of
            several threads blocked on a particular monitor. It seems to be the
            case that the order in which threads acquire a monitor is precisely
            the order in which they arrive at the monitor. However, the
            language specification says explicitly that the order is arbitrary.
            Both make sense to me&mdash;I would expect the JVM to simply use a
            queue of threads, and I would expect the language to not guarantee
            it.</li>

            <li>When checking that a thread has become unblocked, the code
            does a <tt>Thread.yield()</tt> and then asks <tt>ThreadMBean</tt>
            for the thread's status. This does not always give the thread a
            chance to get into the running state. I have improved the
            situation by fiddling with thread priorities&mdash;the parent
            thread (the test itself) is set to <tt>Thread.MIN_PRIORITY</tt>
            and each <tt>TestThread</tt> is set to <tt>Thread.MAX_PRIORITY</tt>
            to give them as much chance as possible to get their act together.
            Even without this priority fiddling, only a few out of several
            thousand test runs was affected by this problem; now it affects
            one out of hundreds of thousands.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>When a waiting thread is notified, is it immediately marked as
        running, possibly to block again reacquiring the monitor, or is it
        immediately marked as blocked on the monitor?  When one thread leaves a
        monitor, is the next thread in the monitor's queue immediately marked
        as running, or does it stay marked as blocked until it gets a
        timeslice?</p>

        <p>If you <b>ever</b> see any of the included tests fail, please
        <a href="mailto:jsampson@users.sourceforge.net">let me know</a> right
        away!</p>

        <h2>Code Review</h2>

        <p>Another caveat is that JThreadUnit does not help to uncover problems
        with unsynchronized access to shared variables. JThreadUnit is based on
        carefully choreographing locking, waiting, and notifying actions to
        make sure that mutual exclusion and signalling are happening as
        expected. This approach can catch deadlocks and certain kinds of race
        conditions as well.</p>

        <p>However, because <tt>TestThread</tt> is synchronized itself, every
        test action is surrounded by memory barriers, causing all variables to
        be flushed to main memory. Therefore JThreadUnit actually hides
        potential problems with memory access. The <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html">double-checked locking</a>
        idiom is an all-too-common example of this kind of error.</p>

        <p>Short of simulating a multi-processor machine, the only way to find
        memory access problems is static code analysis, by peer code review
        with the aid of static analysis tools.</p>

        <p>For example, any code that violates any of these rules requires
        very close scrutiny:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Never read or write a shared variable outside of a synchronized
            block.</li>
            <li>Always surround <tt>wait()</tt> with a while-loop.</li>
            <li>Always use <tt>notifyAll()</tt> instead of <tt>notify()</tt>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Tools such as <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/bugs/">FindBugs</a>
        and <a href="http://artho.com/jlint/index.shtml">JLint</a> perform
        static analysis to automatically detect potential problems with
        unsynchronized access to shared variables, deadlocks, and race
        conditions (as well as other classes of common bugs).</p>

        <p>We should also watch <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~leavens/JML/index.shtml">JML</a>
        and related tools such as <a href="http://krakatoa.lri.fr/">Krakatoa</a>
        and look forward to being able to formally prove our multithreaded Java
        code.</p>
