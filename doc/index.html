        <p>JThreadUnit supports deterministic unit testing of multithreaded
        Java code. It is a simple add-on to the JUnit unit testing framework. A
        test creates several TestThread instances which it can control at
        various granularities, including testing for whether a thread is
        blocked after a controlled sequence of concurrent operations.</p>

        <p>This project already has useful code written for immediate release.
        The project will distribute that code, coordinate enhancements, and
        serve as a focal point for advancing the science and art of
        deterministic unit testing of multithreaded Java code.</p>

        <p>There are a few packages out there for testing multithreaded Java
        code, but all use a nondeterministic load-based approach, executing a
        large number of concurrent operations repeatedly to uncover defects.
        This project will differentiate itself by promoting deterministic unit
        testing techniques.</p>
